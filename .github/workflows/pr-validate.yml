          **For Maintainers**: If this PR is safe to run, you can:
          1. Review the code changes carefully
          2. Re-run the failed workflow manually
          3. Or add the contributor as a collaborator if they'll be contributing regularly
          
          This security measure helps protect against malicious code execution in workflows."
