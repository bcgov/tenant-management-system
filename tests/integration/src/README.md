# Integration Tests

These tests are part of the upstream repo. A dummy test for Express has been
added, and all it does is call the `health` endpoint.

## Running Locally

These tests can be run locally:

- copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
- run `npm ci`
- start the backend (`Run and Debug` in Activity Bar > `TMS` or `TMS Backend`)
- run `node src/main.js`
