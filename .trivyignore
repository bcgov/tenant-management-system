# Trivy complains that containers are running with UID and GID less than 10000.
# In OpenShift, however, the security context automatically assigns UID
# and GID values that are greater than 10000. If deploying outside OpenShift,
# consider setting runAsUser and runAsGroup explicitly in the securityContext.
